<!-- Even if you load an old course, you still need to update wind/rc position -->
<a class="btn btn-default" href="#">Connect to a shared course</a>
<!-- Initially implement this by having a standard course on the system -->
<!-- Value of a shared course is that the rc controlls everything and shares it's position -->


<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Regatta Hub makes building courses and implementing them on the water easy. I might be biased since I built it. If you are having trouble at any point, head over to the <a href="/help/">help section</a>. I do my best to answer all your questions there. If you still need help, head over to the <a href="/contact">contact section</a> or just shoot me an email at russ@regattahub.com.</p>
